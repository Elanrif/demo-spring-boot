## Generate a Secure Key for Signing JWTs

To generate a secure 256-bit (32-byte) key for signing your JWTs, you can use the following command on Linux:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

This command generates a random base64-encoded key. Make sure to store this key in a secure location, such as an environment variable or a secure configuration file.

## What is a JWT?

A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for securely transmitting information between a client and a server as a JSON object. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the token.

For a detailed explanation of JWTs, you can watch this video: [What is a JWT?](https://youtu.be/fskpKoT3eBc?si=UjUe7Rl6aFDqg0TB)

## Additional Resources

For more details on implementing JWT authentication with Spring Boot and Spring Security, you can refer to this comprehensive guide: [Spring Boot JWT Authentication Example](https://github.com/bezkoder/spring-boot-spring-security-jwt-authentication).

This guide covers:

- Configuring Spring Security for JWT.
